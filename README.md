# Web Application of Healthy Pets
## Team member
"**Zijun Mei**" and "**Yimin Li**"<br />
## Abstract
The application our team would make is called healthy pets. The basic blocks of the application include input, search, output and FAQs page, which represent 4 functions of the application. For the input block, the user basically could type the pet information into the database for recording. The search block is made for users to get the information out of the database by type the keywords such as nickname, species, age. After user types in, the web server will respond and give an output page, which essentially shows the result of the searching or inputting. The FAQs page block is made for users to quickly get the direction to experience an application, and it will effectively improve the satisfaction of the user.

## Release Notes

Since this is the first time we try to make a web application and there is only two members in our team, we barely have a direction to the target so that we have to keep in touch and working together all the time for making our work is on the right track. We edited the project plan which we create at the very first so that it can looks more reasonable(the original task 1 is to set up the cloud server, and now is to make the common repository).<br />
So far we create a some basic functions for reacording the information of the pets.
